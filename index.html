        <div id="articleintro" class="64"><p>Since the world wide spy scandal from the NSA in 2013, and most recently, the massive Facebook data breach in 2018, a large part of the world's population is now advice of theses possible dangers and try to secure their personal data. But when did this massive data collection start ? And does this represent a danger ?</p></div>
                
        <div id="articletext" class="74"><p>When you sign up to an online service, such as Facebook for example, you have to tick a box with a message like “You have read and accept the End user license agreement”, also know as “EULA”. It’s a long and boring text, so everybody thick that box, which is required to use the service, without reading the text.  To show that nobody cares about EULA, in 2005, a company named “Pc pit stop”, wrote in their EULA that they will give 1 000 $ at the first person who read that message, they waited during 4 months before somebody contact them for the reward. Back to Facebook, since the beginning of the service, user’s data are collected, some users don’t know that, because they didn’t read EULA. These data are sold, and reuse for multiples usages, the most famous example is targeted advertising. With the development of data analyst, theses data are also used to make statistics.</p>
            <br><p>Electronics devices can also collect private data, our phone, they got a camera and a microphone, they can be the perfect spy tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/2D7_JDayUQM" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;color: #293134;">In the video of the CBC News</a>  , journalists want to show an app can easily spy your life. They created an app who required all permissions of the phone where it is installed, and go meets some peoples in the street and ask them to install the app. All users in the video give required access to the application without take care. At the end, the simple application takes discreetly control of your phone, and collect all messages, record videos from the cameras, and audios from the microphone.</p>
            <p>Another case, the famous Amazon Echo, this connected device record when you ask something to Alexa, and save it on an Amazon server, this is a little weird.</p></div>
    
        <div id="articleintro" class="82" style="border-top: 0.1vw solid #293134;"><p>But what happened when all theses data fall into the wrong hands, get modified or is used for political purposes?</p></div>
    
        <div id="articletext" class="92"><p>In 2018, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook explain how usage of data may have a decisive impact on the 2016 United-states presidential election. Facebook get invaded by fakes news on politicians and may giving the advantage to Donald Trump. </p></div>
    
        <div id="articlequote" class="94"><p>“We have a basic responsibility to protect peoples’ data.” <br><br>Mark Zuckerberg</p></div>
    
        <div id="articletext" class="104"><p>Edward Snowden reveal in 2013 a massive illegal collection of data from the American National Security Agency. Denouncing a secret usage of all these information’s for the security of the country, but violating everyone's privacy. Creating massive scandals and questioning people about secret use of our data.</p></div>
        
        <div id="articleintro" class="114"><p>Even if those differents stories can be scary, your data will be often use for targeted advertising. In the last few years, the user's right to their data has increased considerably, most of applications can now send you all collected data, so you can see what they know about you, and let you have the choice to delete theses data. So, an application, or a connected device can’t really be a danger for you if you take care about what personal information you are spreading to them.</p></div>
