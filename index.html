        <div id="articleintro" class="64"><p>Since the world wide spy scandal from the NSA in 2013, and more recently, the massive Facebook data breach in 2018, a large part of the world's population is now aware of theses possible dangers and try to secure their personal data. But when did this massive data collection start ? And does this represent a danger ?</p></div>
                
        <div id="articletext" class="74"><p>When you sign up to an online service, such as Facebook for example, you have to tick a box with a message like “You have read and accept the End user license agreement”, also known as “EULA”. It’s a long and boring text, so everybody tick that box, which is required to use the service, without reading the text.  To show that nobody cares about EULA, in 2005, a company named “Pc pit stop”, wrote in their EULA that they would give 1 000 $ to the first person who read that message, they waited during 4 months before somebody contacted them for the reward. Back to Facebook, since the beginning of the service, user’s data have been collected, some users don’t know that, because they didn’t read EULA. These data are sold, and reused for multiples purposes, the most famous example is targeted advertising. With the development of data analyst, theses data are also used to make statistics.</p>
            <br><p>Electronics devices can also collect private data, our phone, they got a camera and a microphone, they can be the perfect spy tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/2D7_JDayUQM" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;color: #293134;">In the video of the CBC News</a>  , journalists want to show an app can easily spy your life. They created an app which required all permissions of the phone where it is installed, and went and met some people in the street and asked them to install the app. All users in the video give required access to the application without take care. At the end, the simple application takes discreetly control of your phone, and collects all messages, records videos from the cameras, and audios from the microphone.</p>
            <p>Another case, the famous Amazon Echo, this connected device record when you ask something to Alexa, and save it on an Amazon server, this is a little weird.</p></div>
    
        <div id="articleintro" class="82" style="border-top: 0.1vw solid #293134;"><p>But what happens when all this data falls into the wrong hands, gets modified or is used for political purposes?</p></div>
    
        <div id="articletext" class="92"><p>In 2018, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook explained how the use of data may have had a decisive impact on the 2016 United-states presidential election. Facebook got invaded by fake news on politicians and may have given the advantage to Donald Trump.</p></div>
    
        <div id="articlequote" class="94"><p>“We have a basic responsibility to protect peoples’ data.” <br><br>Mark Zuckerberg</p></div>
    
        <div id="articletext" class="104"><p>Edward Snowden revealed in 2013 a massive illegal collection of data from the American National Security Agency. Denouncing a secret use of all this information for the security of the country, but violating everyone's privacy. Creating massive scandals and questioning people about secret use of our data.</p></div>
        
        <div id="articleintro" class="114"><p>Even if those different stories can be scary, your data will be often used for targeted advertising. In the last few years, the user's right to their data has increased considerably, most applications can now send you all collected data, so you can see what they know about you, and let you have the choice to delete this data. So, an application, or a connected device can’t really be a danger for you if you take care about what personal information you are spreading to them.</p></div>
